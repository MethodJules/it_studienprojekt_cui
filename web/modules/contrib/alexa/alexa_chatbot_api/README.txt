INTRODUCTION
------------

Alexa[2] driver for Chatbot API[1].

See the documentation pages for further details and examples. [3] [4]

DO I NEED THIS MODULE?
------------

You need this module only if you need to use Chatbot API with Alexa.

Also before Chatbot API version 2.x this driver was an API submodule. Due the complexity of hosting the API and multiple
drivers we have decide to separate them.

So you requires this module only if you depend by Chatbot API version 2. If you are using version 1 then you should
already have this module and don't need to download it again.


INSTALLATION
------------

Install the module as you would normally install a contributed Drupal
module.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The module basic functionality doesn't have any configuration. This is only a bridge between Chatbot API and Alexa, so
you just need to configure those.
